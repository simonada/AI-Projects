# AI-Projects
The projects realised for the course VE593:Problem Solving with AI Techniques at the UM-SJTU Joint Institute.

Prerequisites:
- Python3.6
- numpy

The work includes 3 Parts. Along the code the supplementing project report is provided and the project-specific Readme file. Furthermore, I have provided the original problem statement, so that anyone who wants to practice can first try to solve them by themselfes. 

On high level the projects include:
1. Search Algorithms

  1.1. Implementation of the following algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search
  - Uniform-Cost Search
  - Depth-First Search
  - Depth-Limited Search
  - Iterative-Deepening Search
  - A*
  - Monte-Carlo Tree Search
  
  1.2.
  - implementation of the game Clickomania
  - application of two search algorithms to solve the game
  
2. Bayesian Networks

  2.1. Structure and Parameter Learning
  - implementation of K2 Algorithm with two scoring functions (original score and Bayesian Information Criterion)
  - experiments performed with two datasets
  
  2.2. Inference (partially unstable solution)
  - implementation of Variable Elimination to get a probability for an occurence of a query
  - application to the two datasets

3. ANN

  3.1. ANN Implementation
  - training allowed with L1 and L2 regularization, and different activation functions for each layer
  - Feed-forward (returns all results from applying the linear function and the corresponding activation function for every layer) 
  - Inference (returns the final activation result)
  - Back-Propagation
  
  3.2. Application to MNIST
  - includes hyper-parameters tuning, experimental results can be found in the report
