# AI-Projects
The projects realised for the course VE593:Problem Solving with AI Techniques at the UM-SJTU Joint Institute.

Prerequisites:
- Python3.6
- numpy

The work includes 3 Parts. Along the code the supplementing project report is provided and the project-specific Readme file. Furthermore, I have provided the original problem statement, so that anyone who wants to practice can first try to solve them by themselfes. 

On high level the projects include:
1. Search Algorithms

  1.1. Implementation of the following algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search
  - Uniform-Cost Search
  - Depth-First Search
  - Depth-Limited Search
  - Iterative-Deepening Search
  - A*
  - Monte-Carlo Tree Search
  
  1.2.
  - implementation of the game Clickomania
  - implementation of two search algorithms to solve the game
  
2. Bayesian Networks
