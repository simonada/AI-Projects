- available score functions are: K2Score, K2ScoreLogs, and BIC

2. variableelimination.py
- here the main function also demonstrates the algorithm applied to the example from the lecture

3. wine.py and protein.py
- assumed is that the datasets are located in a local folder /data
- the train and test data sets, as well as the learned CPT lists and adjacency matrices are also provided in this folder
